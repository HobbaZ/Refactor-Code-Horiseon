# Horiseon Website Code Refactor

The marketing agency Horiseon has asked that I refactor their website codebase, retaining any existing features and updating accessibility factors for the website.

Looking at the already existing HTML and CSS codebase, it became apparent that the code could be condensed a fair amount. The HTML needed semantic elements to replace divs and from looking at the Css, some individual id elements could be cleaned up to one class and others could be modified for more simplicity.

### Main Code Changes
- Changed div elements to semantic elements, header, footer, aside, figure etc.
- Reduced id's benefit cost, benefits lead and benefit brand to one benefitsAside class, changed Css to suit.
- Reduced the search engine optimization, online reputation management and social media marketing id's to one mediaSections class, also changed    CSS to suit.
- Added a underline hover effect to links so links are more obvious to user.
- Added alt text to all images for screen-reader accessibility.


### Technology Used
- HTML
- CSS
